## Project Summary: Urban Retail Co. Inventory Management Solution

This project aims to develop a comprehensive SQL-driven inventory monitoring and optimization solution for Urban Retail Co., a rapidly expanding retail chain with over 5,000 SKUs across physical stores and online platforms. The company faces challenges such as frequent stockouts, overstocking, lack of real-time insights, and poor visibility across its logistics network.

**Key Tasks and Deliverables:**

**1. SQL Queries:**
*   **Stock Level Calculations:** Across stores and warehouses.
*   **Low Inventory Detection:** Based on reorder points.
*   **Reorder Point Estimation:** Using historical trends.
*   **Inventory Turnover Analysis.**
*   **Summary Reports:** Including KPIs like stockout rates, inventory age, and average stock levels.

**2. Database Optimization:**
*   Normalize a raw inventory dataset into a relational schema.
*   Apply best practices for query performance (indexing, joining, window functions).

**3. Analytical Outputs:**
*   Identify fast-selling vs. slow-moving products.
*   Recommend stock adjustments to reduce holding costs.
*   Highlight supplier performance inconsistencies.
*   Forecast demand trends based on seasonal/cyclical data.

**4. Final Submission:**
*   SQL scripts and documentation.
*   Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) or schema design.
*   Inventory KPI dashboard/report (mocked-up or real).
*   A brief executive summary (1-2 pages) outlining key insights and recommendations.

**Expected Business Impact:**
*   Smarter inventory decisions based on actual data.
*   Reduced stockouts and overstocks.
*   Improved supply chain efficiency.
*   Enhanced customer satisfaction and boosted profitability.

**Overview File Summary (`overview.md`):**
Urban Retail Co. operates with a complex logistics network involving regional warehouses feeding individual retail outlets. Despite having sales transaction, product catalog, and warehouse log data, it is underutilized, leading to inefficiencies. The core problem is reactive, manual decision-making and a lack of integrated data analytics, resulting in missed sales, locked-up working capital, and poor visibility. The project's mission is to leverage SQL-based analytics to convert raw data into actionable insights, simulating the responsibilities of a data analyst in a retail setting. The solution should create efficient and scalable SQL queries, diagnose inefficiencies, suggest corrective actions, predict future needs, and deliver both technical outputs and analytical insights.
