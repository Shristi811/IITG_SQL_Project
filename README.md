# Urban Retail Co. Inventory Management Solution
Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive, SQL-driven inventory monitoring and optimization solution for Urban Retail Co., a rapidly expanding retail chain. The primary goal is to transform raw inventory and sales data into actionable insights to address critical challenges such as frequent stockouts, overstocking, and a lack of real-time visibility across their supply chain.

Key Features and Solutions

1. Database Design and Optimization
Normalized Relational Schema: A robust database schema designed in at least 3rd Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity, reduce redundancy, and optimize query performance.
Indexing Strategy: Conceptual indexing recommendations to accelerate data retrieval and analytical queries.
2. Advanced SQL Queries
A suite of advanced SQL queries has been developed to enable critical inventory management tasks:
-Stock Level Calculations: Comprehensive insights into current inventory levels across individual stores and the entire warehouse network.
-Low Inventory Detection: Proactive identification of products with stock levels falling below predefined reorder points.
-Reorder Point Estimation: Data-driven estimation of optimal reorder points based on historical sales trends and lead times.
-Inventory Turnover Analysis: Assessment of inventory efficiency by calculating turnover ratios for various products.
-Summary Reports with KPIs: Generation of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as stockout rates, inventory age, and average stock levels to provide a holistic view of inventory health.
3. Analytical Outputs and Insights
Python scripts are provided to generate deeper analytical insights:
-Fast-Selling vs. Slow-Moving Products: Identification of product performance to guide stocking and promotional strategies.
-Stock Adjustment Recommendations: Data-backed suggestions for increasing or decreasing stock levels to minimize holding costs and prevent stockouts.
-Supplier Performance Inconsistencies: Analysis of discrepancies between units ordered and sold to highlight potential issues in the supply chain.
-Demand Trend Forecasting: Basic forecasting of future demand trends based on historical data, including seasonal decomposition visualization.

How to Use
Database Setup:

Use the schema.sql file to create the necessary tables in your SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
Populate the tables with data from inventory_forecasting.csv. You may need to write a data loading script or use a database import tool.

Run SQL Queries:

Execute the queries in sql_queries.sql against your populated database to perform stock level calculations, low inventory detection, reorder point estimation, inventory turnover analysis, and generate summary reports.

Run Analytical Scripts:

Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels). You can install them using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib statsmodels
Run the Python scripts (analyze_products.py, stock_adjustment_recommendations.py, supplier_performance_analysis.py, demand_forecasting.py) to generate analytical insights. Ensure inventory_forecasting.csv is in the correct path as referenced by the scripts.

Review Reports and Summaries:
-Examine kpi_dashboard_mockup.md for a conceptual dashboard design.
-Read executive_summary.md for key insights and recommendations.
-Expected Business Impact

By implementing this solution, Urban Retail Co. can expect to:
-Achieve smarter, data-driven inventory decisions.
-Significantly reduce stockouts and overstocks.
-Improve overall supply chain efficiency.
-Enhance customer satisfaction and boost profitability.
