## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Schema Design

### Entities and Relationships:

**1. Products Table:**
*   `product_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each product.
*   `category`: Category of the product (e.g., Toys, Clothing, Electronics).
*   `price`: Price of the product.

**2. Stores Table:**
*   `store_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each store.
*   `region`: Geographic region where the store is located.

**3. Inventory_Transactions Table:**
*   `transaction_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each transaction.
*   `date`: Date of the transaction.
*   `store_id` (Foreign Key): References `store_id` in the `Stores` table.
*   `product_id` (Foreign Key): References `product_id` in the `Products` table.
*   `inventory_level`: Inventory level at the time of the transaction.
*   `units_sold`: Number of units sold in the transaction.
*   `units_ordered`: Number of units ordered in the transaction.
*   `demand_forecast`: Forecasted demand for the product.
*   `discount`: Discount applied to the product.
*   `weather_condition`: Weather condition at the time of the transaction.
*   `holiday_promotion`: Indicates if there was a holiday or promotion.
*   `competitor_pricing`: Competitor's pricing for the product.
*   `seasonality`: Seasonality of the product.

### Relationships:
*   **One-to-Many:** A `Store` can have many `Inventory_Transactions`.
*   **One-to-Many:** A `Product` can have many `Inventory_Transactions`.

### Normalization and Best Practices:

The schema is designed to be in at least 3rd Normal Form (3NF) to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. Each entity (Products, Stores, Inventory_Transactions) has its own table, and relationships are established using foreign keys. This normalization helps in:
*   **Reducing Data Redundancy:** Information about products and stores is stored only once.
*   **Improving Data Integrity:** Changes to product or store information only need to be made in one place.
*   **Enhancing Query Performance:** Normalized tables often lead to more efficient queries, especially when combined with appropriate indexing.

### Indexing Strategy (Conceptual):

To optimize query performance, the following indexes would be beneficial:
*   **Primary Keys:** Automatically indexed by the database.
*   **Foreign Keys:** `store_id` and `product_id` in `Inventory_Transactions` should be indexed to speed up joins.
*   **Frequently Queried Columns:** Columns like `date`, `category`, `region` in `Inventory_Transactions` could be indexed depending on common query patterns.

### Example of Index Creation (Conceptual SQL):

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_store_id ON Inventory_Transactions (store_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_product_id ON Inventory_Transactions (product_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_date ON Inventory_Transactions (date);
CREATE INDEX idx_category ON Products (category);
CREATE INDEX idx_region ON Stores (region);
```
